# Rosetta Code
Part of the Five Languages in Five Weeks challenge is to compare and contrast the different languages being learned. Each language will have a Rosetta Code directory in the repository that represents the code that performs the same actions accross all langues. This project represents the Rosetta Code for the TypeScript language.
