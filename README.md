# Five Languages in Five Weeks: TypeScript
This is the repository for week 1 of my [Five Languages in Five Weeks][fnf] personal challenge. Week 1 focuses on [TypeScript][ts]. Week 1 of the challenge takes place from Friday, December 1, 2017 to Thursday, December 7, 2017.

Each directory has a self-contained project that uses TypeScript.

### Project Listing
**[HelloTypeScript][hts]** - A hello world project written in TypeScript.
**[LanguageFeatures][lf]** - This project exists to demonstrate essential features of the language. 
**[RosettaCode][rc]** - Code written to compare the styles of all languages. The same program is implemented accross each language.
**[TestingTypeScript][tt]** - Project created to get familiar with automated testing using TypeScript.
